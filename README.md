# Collection of Mathematical Methods

It contains a collection of functions/methods commonly used in computational physics.
Unless stated otherwise, the following methods consider univariate functions only.

### Numerical Integration:
- Simpson
- Newton-Cotes
- Gauss-Chebyshev

### Numerical Solution of ODEs:
- Taylor
- Euler
- Runge-Kutta (4th order)
- Adams-Bashforth

### Root Finding methods:
- Bisection
- Fixed Point
- Newton-Raphson
- Secant

### Other Utilities:
- Detect machine's precision
- Change logarithm base
- Fibonacci numbers
- Greatest Common Divisor 
- Primality test
- Check if difference of two values (or arrays) is below threshold
